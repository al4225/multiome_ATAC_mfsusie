# multiome_ATAC_mfsusie

## Goal
The goal of this project is to process raw single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) data from multiome libraries into **base-level chromatin accessibility data** for downstream analysis. This high-resolution data will be used for fine-mapping and multiomic studies, particularly suited for models like **mfsusie**.

## Contents
### ATAC-seq Data Processing Notebook:
- Contains code and steps for processing ATAC-seq fragment data, including:
  - Quality control (QC)
  - Cell-type annotation
  - Base-level coverage calculation and further QC
- Details the structure of the base-level chromatin accessibility data, including:

### Meeting Agenda and To-Do List:
- Summarizes project updates and action items from recent meetings.
